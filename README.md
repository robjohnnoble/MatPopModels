The code is written in R (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)).

If you click on the name of an R file (e.g. SimpleMatrix.R) then you can view the code.

You can run snippets of code online, such as here: https://rdrr.io/snippets/.
 
To run the code on your own computer:
* download and install R (https://cran.rstudio.com/)
* download and install the free version of RStudio (https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
* open RStudio and create a new file (R script)
* copy and paste some code into your new file
* click on the first line of code
* repeatedly click the "Run" button or press Ctrl+Enter (Windows) or Cmd+Enter (Mac) to run each line of code

You can alternatively download the files and save them on your computer (by clicking the green "Code" button on the main page and selecting "Download ZIP"). Or, if you're familiar with GitHub, you can clone this repository.

Lines beginning with # are comments or code that will not be run.
